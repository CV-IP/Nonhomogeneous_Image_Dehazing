# Fast Deep Multi-patch Hierarchical Network for Nonhomogeneous Image Dehazing
The code for implementing the "Fast Deep Multi-patch Hierarchical Network for Nonhomogeneous Image Dehazing" (Accepted at NTIRE Workshop, CVPR 2020).

Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05999

## Highlights

- **Lightweight:** The proposed system is very lightweight as the total size of the model is around 21.7 MB.
- **Training Time Friendly:**  it is quite robust for different environments with various density of the haze or fog in the scene.
- **Fast:** it can process an HD image in 0.0145 seconds on average and can dehaze images from a video sequence in real-time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- **Pytorch** 
- **Scikit-image**  
- **Numpy** 
- **Scipy** 
- **Opencv** 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

For model Inference, run following commands
```
# for Deep Multi-Patch Hierarchical Network
python DMPHN_test.py

# for Deep Multi-Scale Hierarchical Network
python DMSHN_test.py

```

## Running the Training

For model training, run following commands
```
# for Deep Multi-Patch Hierarchical Network
python DMPHN_train.py

# for Deep Multi-Scale Hierarchical Network
python DMSHN_train.py

```
